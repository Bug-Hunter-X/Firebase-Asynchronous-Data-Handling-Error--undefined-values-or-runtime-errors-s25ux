The following Firebase code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations:

```javascript
// Incorrect asynchronous handling
db.ref('path/to/data').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  console.log('Data:', data); // Data might be undefined
  // ... further operations using 'data' ...
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});

// ... later in the code ...
// Trying to access 'data' outside the 'then' block is problematic
console.log('Data outside then block:', data); // Data will be undefined or cause an error
```

This error occurs because asynchronous operations, such as database reads with `once('value')`, don't immediately return data.  The `then` block is executed only after the data is retrieved asynchronously. Trying to access the `data` variable outside the `then` block results in undefined or error because the asynchronous operation might not have completed yet.
